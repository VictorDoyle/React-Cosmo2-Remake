# Basics

This project was made to recreate the Cosmo2 website with the utmost fidelity to visuals, animations and styling. The original website is made with Wordpress and a pre-existing theme. I wanted to explore recreating this website with a React.js front end and recreating these animations and visuals myself.

The original website: https://www.cosmo2.eu/
